961,Michael, mmm mm mm maybe  ,1,4
962,Michael, it looks like theres gonna be downsizing and its part of my job but blah i hate it i think the main difference between me and donald trump is that uh i get no pleasure out of saying the words youre fired as donald trump youre foired uh youre foired it just makes people sad and an office cant function that way no way as donald trump youre foired  i think if i had a catchphrase it would be youre hired and you can work here as long as you want but thats unrealistic so  ,1,4
963,Dwight, its a real shame cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through watercooler gossip than through official memos which puts me at a disadvantage because i bring my own water to work  ,1,4

2392,Jim,  the weird part about this whole deal this that michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational i mean he puts more effort and time and commitment into the dundies than anything else he does all year which is probably why this branch will be downsized  ,2,1

10024,Dwight, i dont believe that jim moved that coat rack but if he did he has an obligation to use his gift wisely with great power comes great responsibility they could do a crosssection of his brain to find out more but i dont think its true though  ,2,22

10138,Michael, anythings possible,3,1
10140,Michael, laughs well im not gay jan and you should know that better than anybody,3,1
10142,Michael, the company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100000 years of being weirded out by gays  ,3,1
10144,Michael,  trick question  cause you cant always tell so how would i know  is that the right answer  ,3,1
10145,Pam, michael dwights looking at gay pornography on his computer,3,1
10146,Dwight, uh michael knows pam  he asked me to do this just for him  he has his own reasons  ,3,1
10147,Michael, looking at gay porn nothing wrong with this stuff  at all  this is fine  you know what  gay porn straight porn its all goooooood  i dont particularly get into this  but uh you know what  i totally see the merit  and actually it is quite beautiful  ,3,1
10148,Dwight, ah damn popups,3,1
10151,Michael, yelling all right everybody in the conference room  i dont care if you are gay or straight or a lesbian or overweight  just get in here  right now    ,3,1
10152,Michael,  did you know that gay used to mean happy  when i was growing up it meant lame  and now it means a man who makes love to other men    ,3,1
10153,Michael,  were all homos  homosapiens  gays arent necessarily who you think they are people  i mean anybody could be gay  businessmen  like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants  oscar why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here  however you want to do it  go ahead  stand up  im doing this for you,3,1
10156,Michael,  who should be the judges and juries of our society,3,1
10158,Michael,  yes thats a good point  she has a good point  because gay marriage currently is not legal under us law  i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them  so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could  you know  sounds pretty good right,3,1
10160,Dwight,  i think all the other office gays should identify themselves or i will do it for them,3,1
10162,Dwight,  what about phyllis  she makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine,3,1
10164,Michael,  thats great  congratulations phyllis  that is great and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing  laughs see  everybody has a chance  ,3,1
10165,Michael,  but still phyllis in college  did you ever experiment with other women  a lot of women do,3,1

10169,Michael,  well i just like to look good ok so ,3,1
10171,Michael,  no i am just coming out myself  i am coming out hetero,3,1
10173,Michael, no no no  the only signal that i am sending is,3,1
10174,Michael,  look if i was gay i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen  i would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just i would be waving that rainbow flag,3,1
10176,Michael,  you misunderstand ok  you know what ok  i uh im gonna put my money where my mouth is  you ready  i am going to embrace oscar  you might want to watch this angela because you cant catch anything  here we go  we are going to make a statement  you and i are going to make a statement together  oscar is my friend ,3,1
10178,Michael, and i just dont care who sees it doesnt bother me  ,3,1
10180,Michael, all right um sorry,3,1

10184,Michael,  embracing oscaryou know what im going to raise the stakes  i want you to watch this  and i want you to burn this into your brains  because this is an image that i want you people to remember for a long time to come  whenever you come into the office i want you to think about this  awkwardly kissing oscar  i did it  see  im still here  were all still here everyone claps,3,1
10185,Michael,  dwight gets up to kiss oscar  oh come on  dwight  come on man  ,3,1
10186,Michael,  we are not in the playground anymore  there are new rules  we have to be mature  but we cant lose the spirit of child like wonder  what is love  anyway  maybe its supposed to break all the rules  like me and jan  or oscar and some guy  life is short  when two people find each other what should stand in their way  ,3,1
10187,Michael,  i am glad that today spurred social change  thats part of my job as regional manager  but you know what  even if it didnt at least we put this matter to bed  thats what she said  or he said  ,3,1

10957,Dwight, when i die i wanna be frozen and if they have to freeze me in pieces so be it  i will wake up stronger than ever because i will have used that time to figure out exactly why i died and what moves i could have used to defend myself better now that i know what hold he had me in   ,3,4
10958,Michael, i dont understand we have a day honoring martin luther king but he didnt even work here ,3,4

10962,Michael, thoughtfully a statue  ,3,4
10964,Michael, yeah,3,4
10966,Michael, well i think it would be very realistic it would look just like him ,3,4
10968,Michael, we could have his eyes light up we could have his arms move ,3,4
10969,Dwight, that is not a statue that is a robot,3,4
10970,Michael, i think that is a great way to honor ed,3,4

11008,Michael, there are five stages to grief which are glancing at computer screen denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance  and right now out there theyre all denying the fact that theyre sad  and thats   hard  and its making them all angry  and it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance  and if not acceptance then just depression  if i can get them depressed then ill have done my job  ,3,4
11009,Michael, i am going to throw you this ball  when you catch the ball i want you to say the name of a person very important to you somebody really special who died and then i want you to say how they died and you may cry if you like that is encouraged  let me just start  let me show you how this works   i catch the ball  i lost ed truck  and it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears and at the same time somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone and im crying and nobody can hear me because i am terribly terribly terribly alone ,3,4
11011,Michael, okay fine  hurry back,3,4

11093,Dwight, always runs off  ,3,4
11094,Pam, did i wake up this morning thinking id be throwing together a bird funeral  you never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into  ,3,4
11096,Jim, whered i find what  ,3,4
11097,Jim, i called the manufacturer who referred me to distributor who referred me to the vending machine company who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door   ,3,4
11098,Michael, glad you could all make it,3,4
11100,Michael, dwight do you have the box,3,4
11101,Pam, actually i have it ,3,4
11102,Michael, you made this  wow impressed thats thats very nice  ,3,4
11104,Pam, id also like to say a few words if thats okay,3,4
11105,Michael, yes,3,4
11106,Pam, what do we know about this bird  you might think not much  its just a bird  but we do know some things  we know it was a local bird  maybe its that same bird that surprised oscar that one morning with a special present from above,3,4
11108,Pam, and we know how he died  flying into the glass doors  but you know what  i dont think he was being stupid  i think he just really really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song,3,4
11109,Dwight, hes not a songbird ,3,4
11110,Michael, shhh,3,4
11111,Pam, an impression then  lastly we cant help but notice that he was by himself when he died but of course we all know that doesnt mean he was alone  because im sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much  he will not be forgotten ,3,4
11113,Dwight, begins playing recorder,3,4
11114,Pam, singing just smile for me and let the day begin  you are the sunshine that lights my heart within on the wings of love    ,3,4
11115,Michael, society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong well thats baloney because grief isnt wrong there is such a thing as good grief just ask charlie brown   ,3,4
11116,Dwight, lets get back to work   ,3,4
11119,Jim, umm sure,3,4
11121,Jim, chuckles hes so cute,3,4
11123,Jim, thats okay hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby oh no its not im sorry is that your husband in the tub with him,3,4
11125,Jim, sounds good  ,3,4
11128,Michael, oh wow he,3,4
11130,Michael, does his family know,3,4
11132,Michael, but im the first in the office,3,4
11134,Michael, okay yes sure i will do that,3,4
11136,Michael, cause im the first to to find out nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them well good how are you holding up want me to come over jan hangs up  ,3,4
11137,Michael, ed truck died and it blows they say that with grief time makes it worse which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so ive had more time to be sad  ,3,4
11139,Dwight, attention everyone as you know ed truck is dead if you have any contact information on rolodex files or in microsoft outlook remove it now also if you have any photographs pam will make her shredder available during lunch that is all  ,3,4
11140,Dwight, remembering the dead doesnt help anybody the way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again in this case some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body im working on both  ,3,4
11142,Michael, i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor we need to find out what is blocking you and that way well be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored may he rest in peace,3,4
11144,Michael, what was that kevin,3,4
11146,Michael, no you said something didnt you,3,4
11148,Michael, you think thats funny,3,4
11150,Michael, you are disgusting,3,4
11151,Dwight, michael no need to call corporate we are supposed to use toby hes trained as a grief counselor,3,4
11152,Michael, no that cant be right,3,4
11154,Michael, well then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world doesnt it  ,3,4
11157,Pam, hi,3,4
11159,Pam, well i will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone ive never met,3,4
11161,Pam, closer to the epicenter i guess,3,4
11166,Michael, youre ruining it already they should not be given the choice  ,3,4
11174,Michael, wow wow no no you are the most heartless soulless person ive ever met,3,4
11176,Michael, no no shh enough it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here dwight ryan i want you to take the table out were gonna go on a five minute break and when you come back were going to start with a clean slate and in the interim i would like you to forget everything that toby has said okay  ,3,4
11177,Michael, i dont think im overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company and he is worthless you give people a chance to shine and they blow it just like you knew they would grief counseling is not about are you hungry would you like a sandwich these people are so far gone you have to stick a food tube down their throats  ,3,4
11179,Michael, okay part of the problem was that toby talked at you now i am going to talk with you first off i want you to be comfortable because you really cant grieve if youre all tight and buttoned up so guys loosen your ties just take your jackets off if you want ladies let your hair down you know what even take your shoes off i wanna get personal and i want you all to really open up and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said,3,4
11182,Michael, i found an exercise in tobys binder that he managed to miss that involves screening the part of you that says i dont wanna do that i dont wanna talk about that that is too private heres how it works im going to throw you this ball  ,3,4
11186,Pam, really,3,4
11188,Pam, wow i thought that was supposed to be like next month,3,4
11190,Pam, yeah id love to see them oh and tell them i say congratulations,3,4
11192,Pam, i should probably head back in,3,4
11194,Pam, but umm thanks for the break,3,4

15502,Michael, oh it sounded interesting what you were gonna  ,3,18
15503,Dwight, i saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed  his head was thrown back his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position  perp grabbed the victim  i removed my weapon from its secure hiding place,3,18
15505,Dwight, irrelevant  discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrators eyes nose and face area  rendering him utterly and completely disabled  then i contacted the authorities  the end,3,18

15531,Michael, tactic number six  change the location of the meeting at the last second  totally throws em off  ,3,18
15532,Michael, number 14 declining to speak first  makes them feel uncomfortable puts you in control    ,3,18
15533,Michael, long pause i am declining to speak first,3,18
15535,Michael, hmm  ohh darryl  you are a good worker and a good man  i just you know times are tight  and i just dont think corporate is going to go for this right now  ,3,18

15551,Michael, there were these huge bins of clothes and everybody was rifling through them like crazy and i grabbed one  and it fit  so i dont think that this is totally just a womans suit  at the very least its bisexual  ,3,18
15553,Michael, uh reading the inside of his jacket missterious  and it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side thats the mystery,3,18
15555,Michael, okay,3,18

15558,Jim, so none of that tipped you off,3,18

15568,Michael, um lets just do this in 15 minutes,3,18
15570,Michael, negotiations are all about controlling things  about being in the drivers seat  and make one tiny mistake youre dead  i made one tiny mistake  i wore womans clothes  ,3,18
15581,Michael, lets get down to business  why dont you tell me why you think you deserve a raise  ,3,18
15583,Michael, mumbles jibberish,3,18
15585,Michael, mumbling softly that was a very good point,3,18
15587,Michael, mumbling softly you make a very compelling argument  ,3,18
15588,Pam, sorry i almost got you killed  ,3,18
15589,Jim, yeah that was nuts,3,18
15590,Pam, he could have broken your nose or something  crazy  its just so stupid  i mean getting back with roy and everything  i mean what was i thinking right,3,18

15614,Jim, ok if you dont want a gift at least let me buy you a beer or lunch or something,3,18

18133,Michael, you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you and then you run over one person with your car sighs and its not even one of the popular ones and everybody gets on your case doesnt make any sense god is dead,4,1
18135,Michael, maybe believing in god was the mistake what did people believe in before the sun maybe theres some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice too like a giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer with ah the body of a porcupine ,4,1

20240,Pam,  how about darryl,4,5
20241,Michael,  actually im a little concerned about having a black person do the music because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a celestine prophesy and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano  ,4,5
20242,Jim,  michael is on a mission to prove that hes creative  which i think is odd because michael actually might be the most creative person ive ever known  every day michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before  ,4,5

20260,Dwight, he looks like your twin,4,6

20627,Michael, when jan and i had satellite we used to watch a reality show called survivorman and it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die try not to get eaten by an animal or be overexposed  ,4,7

20647,Jim, thatd be great  ,4,7
20648,Dwight, do i believe that michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment lets put it this way,4,7
20649,Michael, this is what a true survivor man does you simulate a disaster like a plane wreck you could only wear the clothes that you have on and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets now in this case this disaster is a serial killer creepy guy whos abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead ,4,7
20650,Dwight, no i would never leave you for dead you would never escape,4,7
20651,Michael, well yes i would and i would survive ,4,7
20652,Dwight, i would make sure that you were dead,4,7
20653,Michael, well,4,7
20654,Dwight, first i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified ,4,7
20655,Michael, you,4,7
20656,Dwight, and they would call me the overkill killer,4,7
20657,Michael, you you are as creepy as a real serial killer for real blindfolds eyes with tie ok,4,7
20658,Dwight, what are you doing ,4,7
20659,Michael, i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings now this way i cant retrace my steps i dont know what streets weve been dwight whacks michael with his shoe ow what are you doing,4,7

20672,Michael, flashback to stanleys birthday look at those wrinkles blacks do crack not crack the drug  ,4,7
20673,Jim, and the other is something inappropriate or horrible or both what else he only sings the high harmony to happy birthday and hes a very big believer in surprise parties maybe even arguably possibly to a fault  ,4,7

23829,Andy, really dwight closes his eyes clutches the paper in his hands huh thats cool,5,2
23830,Jim, storys kinda bland  its about this guy named dumbledore calrissian who needs to return the ring back to mordor,5,2

23841,Jim, he has not stopped working for a second  at 1245 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open which i always thought was impossible  at 132 he peed and i know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports  and on the flip side i have been so busy watching him that i havent even started work  its exhausting being this vigilant  ill probably have to go home early today  ,5,2

23850,Michael, i will be honest with you  that car ride did not go well and that was not my fault  the only reason i am standing out here right now is because i dont want to take the elevator with her  and i am holding on to her leftovers throws hollys leftovers in the trash  ,5,2
23851,Jim, dwight walks back to his desk 19 minutes and 48 seconds  what were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds,5,2

26345,Michael, pam would you stand up for a sec sits in pams chair hmm see how relaxed i am i like this chair slowly sinking into the chair offers good support it is urkelnomically correct its a good chair i think were spoiled because we dont appreciate the things that we have you think kids in africa have chairs no they sit in big piles of garbage you think they have copiers  the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where michael is not visible over the desk they dont have copiers they dont even struggles to get up from pams chair gah they dont even have paper and we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it my point i this i have seen the light in terms of what we need and it is nothing,5,9

31613,Andy,   oui oui monsieur  from the wisconsin region a nice firm cheddar  also from the great state of wisconsin an aged parmesan  here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which i think youll  find both challenging and delicious  at that point i would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of illinois where you will find this fine bleu cheese dressing  if i may be so bold its a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese  bon appetit  ,6,2

31839,Jim, yes,6,3
31840,Michael, no i dont think they are i think the meetings are very important ,6,3

31846,Michael, alright jim to be fair the conversation wasnt about planets ,6,3
31847,Jim, right,6,3
31848,Michael, at first we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon so you draw a line from there to the other planets and i think by the end we all learned a little bit about how small we are,6,3
31849,Jim, yes i agree ,6,3
31850,Michael, because its a big universe and were all just little tiny specks of dust ,6,3
31851,Jim, i just think that maybe theyre eating large amounts of the day,6,3
31852,Michael, you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps you go to sleep its light out you wake up its dark thats the whole day where did that day go i have no idea,6,3
31853,Jim, you mean on a weekend,6,3
31854,Michael, yes,6,3
31855,Jim, how about this i think our goal should be we dont have meetings unless theyre absolutely essential ,6,3
31856,Michael, alright no more meetings this week ,6,3
31857,Jim, really you just agreed to that,6,3
31858,Michael, i can be very suprising  ,6,3
31860,Pam, i need to fit into my wedding dress however im also pregnant,6,3
31863,Pam, we did but mostly because people expect us to were also accepting other gifts not on the registry however much  ,6,3
31864,Pam, its awkward asking people for money but we could really use it why doesnt crate  barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash   ,6,3
31866,Pam, oh good,6,3

31878,Michael, what do you mean by these people,6,3
31879,Jim, michael this is a conference room meeting,6,3
31880,Michael, oh hey everybody i think that jim has gone insane because he thinks that my office is a conference room,6,3
31881,Jim, thats not what i meant,6,3
31882,Michael, listen jim no offense but when push comes to shove what i want is more important that what you want,6,3
31883,Jim, i disagree,6,3
31884,Michael, what do you guys think all start talking at the same time ,6,3
31885,Jim, great guys can i just have a moment alone with michael,6,3
31886,Michael, no no no you dont need to go anywhere anything that jim has to say to me he can say in front of these types of people ,6,3
31887,Jim, that is not what i said and also i am comanager meaning you are not the only manager anymore i am also i comanager,6,3
31888,Michael, that is not what wallace told us ,6,3
31889,Jim, thats exactly what wallace told us,6,3
31890,Michael, that is not the way i heard it  ,6,3
31892,Michael, it is one thing me giving you the comanager title it is another thing you bossing me around ,6,3
31893,Jim, im not bossing you around im trying to do my job which is sharing your job so maybe we should just call david wallace,6,3

31914,Jim, you dont have to lie ,6,3
31915,Michael, i hate the fact that we have to do this together i think we work better separately when i am irritated and i look at you i dont see you anymore ,6,3
31916,Jim, right ,6,3
31917,Michael, all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are,6,3
31918,Jim, alright lets get started  ,6,3
31921,Michael, you know theres no easy way to do this i say we add 15 to their paychecks and dont say anything about it,6,3
31922,Jim, do you mean like breakin in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll,6,3
31923,Michael, no we can do it during the day it doesnt have to be that dramatic jim,6,3
31924,Jim, okay you know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options ,6,3
31925,Michael, jim dont take this the wrong way are you gonna take this the wrong way,6,3
31926,Jim, its hard to tell so far,6,3
31927,Michael, you use your brain too much,6,3
31928,Jim, im sorry are you advocating that i use it less,6,3
31929,Michael, sometimes the smartest people dont think at all,6,3
31930,Jim, you just came up with that,6,3
31931,Michael, as i was saying it,6,3
31932,Jim, yeah okay so for the 15 increase pro everyone gets a little bit ,6,3
31933,Michael, in nerdy voice con you look like a nerd,6,3
31934,Jim, con no one gets as much as they did last year,6,3
31935,Michael, pro you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds,6,3
31936,Jim, pro no favoritism ,6,3
31937,Michael, con you unzip your pants and you find that theres a calculator down there  ,6,3
31938,Jim, ive been studying michael for years and ive condensed what ive learned into this chart pulls out a pie chart how michael spends his time as you can see we have procrastinating and distracting others and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking i made it bigger so that you could see it  ,6,3
31940,Pam, i dont think we registered anywhere we just want cash,6,3
31942,Pam, mmhmm,6,3
31944,Pam, yeah,6,3
31946,Pam, okay,6,3
31948,Pam, is this what ive become materialistic shallow i feel horrible looks down at the check oh look mrs pam halpert thats the first time ive seen it in writing  ,6,3
31949,Jim, you know the more i think about it the more i think we should give it to the salesmen ,6,3
31950,Michael, that will not go over well ,6,3
31951,Jim, i know i just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now course i know that this might come off as biased so you know what let us ,6,3
31952,Michael, oh my god are you gonna make another pro and con list im gonna kill myself ,6,3
31953,Jim, im not gonna let you stop me from thinking ,6,3
31954,Michael, no i could not do that jim i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect if i can just think this through if i could just think it exactly right i can make this perfect and then i can go down every avenue and every avenue off of that avenue and then another avenue ,6,3
31955,Jim, michael ,6,3
31956,Michael, and then another,6,3
31957,Jim, look you have a lot of strengths,6,3
31958,Michael, oh i do tell me what they are ,6,3
31959,Jim, i think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well ,6,3
31960,Michael, ha that i am not known for that,6,3
31961,Jim, but there is a reason why im here,6,3
31962,Michael, yes you went over my head to wallace,6,3
31963,Jim, no its because you also have a lot of weaknesses michael,6,3
31964,Michael, okay well why dont you tell me what those are jim why dont you enliven me,6,3
31965,Jim, i dont think youre good at making tough decisions,6,3
31966,Michael, ah ,6,3
31967,Jim, at thinking out the options and then stating that decision very clearly especially when its an unpopular decision ,6,3
31968,Michael, okay heres a tough decision for you you suck you suck is that clear enough for you,6,3
31969,Jim, but maybe im here for a reason because i might have some good ideas too ive been sitting out there and ive been learning a lot and maybe i can just bring something different to the table ,6,3
31970,Michael, okay skippy here we go why dont you run yourself out there and tell them laughs you call it,6,3
31971,Jim, leave the conference room to address everyone,6,3
31972,Michael, to the camera this had better be terrible ,6,3
31973,Jim, could i have everyones attention please i have some tough news so im just gonna give it to you straight truth is we only have so much money for raises this year so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people wont now what weve decided is we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff ,6,3
31975,Jim, look you guys are smart so im just leveling with you im just trying to treat you like adults ,6,3
31979,Jim, ooh easy thats not it at all ,6,3
31981,Jim, really what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the office  ,6,3
31987,Dwight, this is ridiculous how could he do this to us,6,3
31988,Jim, okay dwight you know what youd be getting the raise so,6,3
31989,Dwight, what about all these people huh how is it fair to them,6,3
31997,Dwight, her kid needs shoes jim,6,3
31999,Jim, wow im just gonna rewind and back off a bit so imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles michael comes over by jim laughing,6,3
32000,Michael, that was good that was good okay all right well we all know its hard to be a boss right you know what look around you these are your best friends these are the people who will open their hearts to you they all have heartons for you someone growns in disgust and that is a gift so in terms of gifts we should be giving each other gifts angela yes lend oscar a cup of sugar this,6,3
32003,Michael, my plan a man panama ,6,3
32004,Andy, thats not how that goes ,6,3
32006,Jim, thank you meredith ,6,3
32009,Michael, alright let me get this clear does everybody want a raise all say yes alright everyone wants a raise so what were going to do is go into here and we will not come out until we do ,6,3
32012,Michael, what about a raise based on merit ,6,3
32013,Jim, rank each person individually,6,3
32014,Michael, mmhmm piece of cake ryan obviously the best ,6,3
32015,Jim, sarcastically well obviously too bad hes a temp and doesnt count so lets get started starts to write on a piece of paper  ,6,3
32016,Michael, are you making a,6,3
32017,Jim, nope im numbering the paper   ,6,3
32022,Dwight, out the side of his mouth and jim,6,3
32024,Dwight, i think it was creed ,6,3
32026,Jim, to camera its going really well actually   ,6,3
32027,Jim, to camera holds up a bean each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise we each got 24 beans so the idea is you place the bean on the picture walking around the table of who you think deserv whos that picture that michael drew of toby looks like a monster,6,3
32028,Michael, toby,6,3
32029,Jim, hes not a part of this you know that ,6,3
32030,Michael, just wanted to draw a picture of him ,6,3
32031,Jim, okay your move ,6,3
32032,Michael, alright who to pick walking around the table who to pick ,6,3
32033,Jim, here we go ,6,3
32034,Michael, i will skip a turn ,6,3
32035,Jim, okay youre gonna still have to play that bean you know that,6,3
32036,Michael, i need more time ,6,3
32038,Dwight, people are starting to notice how terrible jim is its great eventually theyll rise up and revolt my only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later if the people here were our founding fathers the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years because stanley washington was napping and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly   ,6,3
32039,Dwight, come on in everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table   thats right come in feast your eyes they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces,6,3
32041,Dwight, things were not this bad when just michael was manager ,6,3
32042,Michael, hey what are you guys doing in here ,6,3
32044,Pam, why arent there any beans on this very old frizzyhaired picture of me,6,3
32046,Pam, jim,6,3
32047,Jim, i was just trying to be unbiased,6,3
32053,Andy, theres no way that stanley gets more beans than me starts to take stanleys beans stanley swats andys hand with his crossword puzzle that is ridiculous this is how it works everyone continues to argue    ,6,3
32055,Andy, thank you that is exactly by the way i would also like a raise,6,3
32057,Dwight, are we idiots gets up starts walking around what right does jim have to claim authority hmm is he as good a salesman as i is he as matronly as phyllis there are moments where we can affect change for a few seconds every decade we exist and these are those seconds let us storm his castle come on tick lets get him tock lets get jim tick and drag jim out of his office tock take his keys away from him tick thats a clock the time is getting very close its now or never what say you,6,3
32059,Dwight, no i mean what do you say to my plan all groan okay,6,3

32337,Jim, alright hey everyone thanks for coming,6,4
32339,Jim, aw thanks pete that was really nice i just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight and i want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight especially the flordia cousins who obviously cant take a hint laughter four years ago i was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend and i had to do the hardest thing that ive ever had to do which was just to wait uh dont get me wrong i flirted with her pam i can now admit in front of my friends and family that i do know how to make a photo copy didnt need your help that many times and do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick,6,4
32340,Pam, like a year,6,4
32341,Jim, ive been driving stick since high school so yes for a really long time thats all i had i just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend and a lot of people told me i was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who i worked with but i think even then i knew that i was waiting for my wife so  i would like to propose a toast so if youd all raise your glasses not pam for obvious reasons but everyone else if you would raise your glasses,6,4
32343,Jim, pam cant drink i didnt i shouldnt have said that i dont know why i did she can do whatever she wants though she shouldnt she shouldnt because shes an alcoholic pam is an alcoholic thats not true i no what we want the real reason is that that pams pregnant,6,4
32344,Michael, clears throat ok ok hey what i think jim is trying to say is that they had an accident and you know what these two people theyre living together theyre having lots of consentual sex,6,4
32346,Michael, yes yes they were living together yes and you know what you cant expect them to be careful every time because frankly its just a different sensation,6,4
32347,Jim, michael,6,4
32348,Michael, when you c well am i wrong they say its not different but its a different sensation,6,4
32349,Jim, oh my god please,6,4
32350,Michael, when you use something to block i think everybody knows what i am talking about its not necessarily different for the woman,6,4
32351,Pam, michael,6,4

34319,Dwight, recyclops will have his revenge  ,6,10
34320,Jim, i think this was also the year he renounced earth day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved  ,6,10

34746,Michael, ah  all right  i came here today because i promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable  but you know whats invaluable is intuition  you know what that is  that is the ability to know when something is about to happen  does anybody out there have intuition  know whats gonna happen next  nobody  okay youre going to make me say it  all right i am so proud of all of you  derrick and lefevre and ben and ayana and mikela and nikki and jason and im sorry okay sorry spacing your name,6,11
34748,Michael, well zion i am not going to be paying for your college tuition  which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybodys tuition  im so so sorry  ,6,11
34749,Michael, im sorry  im sorry  im so sorry,6,11
34751,Michael, i lied to myself too  im not a millionaire  i thought i would be by the time i was 30 but i wasnt even close  and then i thought maybe by the time i was 40 but by 40 i had less money than when i was 30  maybe by my 50s i dont know  i wanted to pay for your education  i really did  it was my dream  some people have evil drems some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams  my dream was in the right place,6,11
34753,Michael, okay hold on  hold on  now i cant pay for your college  but you dont have to go to class to be in class  online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience  and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop students perk up which is rendered useless without batteries and i have one for each of you,6,11

35938,Pam,  if we check in after midnight i get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors,6,16
35939,Jim,  not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home if its crying all night one of us is going to have to take care of it  and i do not plan on helping unless its a boy,6,16
35940,Pam,  i cannot wait for that joke to be over  ,6,16

35949,Jim,  hmm that logics airtight but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here  burning man portopotty,6,16
35950,Michael,  oh yuck  tmi  how was it  i dont want to know  tell me later  lets go  lets go  hospital,6,16
35951,Pam,  okay okay were not going to the hospital  we are waiting until midnight,6,16
35953,Jim,  because the insurance company only covers two nights,6,16
35954,Pam,  everythings fine  we have plenty of time,6,16
35956,Michael,  shut up nick  what a weird thing to say  weird it nerd  dont get revenge on me nerd,6,16

35969,Andy,  yeah no you really should  because if your babys born tomorrow hes going to have the same birthday as buttmud brooks  my old roommate,6,16
35970,Pam,  did you hear that  buttmud brooks,6,16
35971,Jim,  okay but we are leaving at five minutes apart,6,16
35972,Pam,  five minutes apart  ,6,16
35973,Jim,  so the plan was seven minutes  but were calling an audible because thats her call  because shes the quarterback  im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant  ,6,16
35974,Pam,  okay stop watching me,6,16
35975,Jim,  okay crazy  i think i have some better things to do with my day than worry about you like sell printers,6,16

35977,Jim,  well not until friday 20 off toner cartridges thats a big deal  while were on the subject why dont i just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check,6,16
35978,Pam,  not until midnight,6,16
35979,Andy,  guys  word of advice  speaking as a former baby  dont get too hung up on baby names  i was named walter jr after my father until i was about six or so when my parents changed their minds,6,16
35981,Andy,  my brother was born and my parents felt he better exemplified the walter jr name so they gave it to him  i was given andrew which they got out of a baby name book,6,16
35982,Jim,  you know its getting real crowded in here  maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet,6,16
35983,Michael,  no no no no no  you know what  you cant tell us what to do because you are not comanager anymore,6,16
35984,Jim,  as andy and kevin shout yeah in response to michael okay i feel like this noise is going to prevent pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals,6,16
35985,Pam,  actually the distractions are good  i mean i dont think im going to make it until midnight if im just sitting here thinking about it,6,16
35986,Michael,  distractions are good  that means conference room five minutes  no no five seconds  right now right now  conference room  topic potpourri  lets go  ,6,16
35987,Michael,  um i am sort of a master of distraction  when i was a kid my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class  try to think what were the first thirteen colonies  mmhmm mmhmm  michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises  ,6,16
35988,Michael,  the purpose for this meeting is to take pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body,6,16
35989,Andy,  can we do sleight of hand tricks,6,16
35990,Michael,  i will allow that,6,16

36004,Michael,  as pam gives the thumbs up  that sounds good  do you need some music or  okay,6,16
36005,Andy,  nope actually music would just throw me off  i need complete silence  okay  pam begins to clap as andy dances  youre clapping  i need complete silence  totally threw me off so im going to have to start over  evolution of dancedance,6,16

37686,Andy, why would that be something to talk about on secretarys day,6,20
37687,Michael, andy shes not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with all right and besides who doesnt tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them thats like thats like mr and mrs smith crap,6,20
37688,Andy, i was going to tell her just on my own time,6,20
37689,Michael, you know what i resent the implication that i would keep that secret everyone here knows that i cant and wont keep a secret  ,6,20
37690,Andy, who cares i mean its not like i killed someone big deal right this can blow over in two seconds she never asked me so if you think about it i probably should have told her i guess everybody does stupid things   ,6,20

37850,Dwight, oh man white people right,6,21
37852,Dwight, well you can kinda tell from the voice,6,21
37854,Dwight, i bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot just because of your race,6,21
37856,Dwight, i think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program ,6,21
37858,Dwight, i know cause you have no role models how many indian ceos can you think of,6,21
37860,Dwight, you could be the indian bill gates you could be the indian ted turner,6,21

37865,Michael, and that would be a display image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up of the crisp gorgeous black,6,21
37867,Michael, its subtle thats how it works i show her an image that turns her on and then she looks at me then back at me then back at the image soon she doesnt know what is me what is the image she just knows that shes turned on   ,6,21
37868,Michael, this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts ive never taken anybody there before,6,21

37882,Jim, well maybe you shouldnt try to kiss people at work ,6,21
37883,Michael, oh really jim what about pam and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss maybe this could be my pam ,6,21
37884,Jim, okay well all that is irrelevant,6,21
37885,Pam, maybe michael has a point i mean if she was really that upset she wouldnt still be here   ,6,21
37887,Michael, look i know that i screwed up in there i know that i probably messed up your sale i just want to go in and fix it ,6,21

42390,Michael, i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer and some people you dont and thats just the way it is and i can be mature about that clip of michael throwing hollys woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it  ,7,11
42395,Michael, what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window you know what would have happened the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off and yes it might have been funny but it also would have been incredibly tragic,7,11
42396,Dwight, i could not agree more and just want to state for the record that i am intending to sue jim for acute psychological distress,7,11
42397,Jim, what are you talking about youre the one terrorizing me,7,11
42398,Dwight, with snowballs jim with fluffy little snowballs no i thought we were just playing,7,11
42400,Michael, all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story you see this on my desk he holds up a toy taxi cab know who gave me this my girlfriend tara who lives in new york city,7,11
42401,Dwight, wait what girlfriend,7,11
42402,Michael, i havent told you about her,7,11

42406,Michael, i do she is  ,7,11
42407,Michael, did you see her face well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g scott and it aint tara  ,7,11

42425,Andy, why would anyone frame you for that,7,11
42426,Jim, okay im sorry why are we discounting this whole woody came to life thing so quickly,7,11

48264,Dwight, the accountability booster it registers every time a mistake has been made in the office from a late delivery to an accounting error five strikes in a day equals a home run one home run and youre out  ,8,6
48265,Andy, if we as a group make five mistakes in a day something bad happens like we block minesweeper  ,8,6
48266,Dwight, or in this case an email gets sent to robert california containing the consultants report from last year remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown and as a failsafe also every negative email youve ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him  ,8,6
48268,Dwight, roberts favorite songs creep by tlc creep by radio head you remember that one jim there is no way he hasnt strangled at least one stripper oscar he eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him kelly  ,8,6

48951,Andy, unless youre going on the very speciallycreated and meticulouslyresearched andy bernard tour  ,8,8
48952,Andy, after chancellorsville lee brought his army up the shenandoah valley right through here they stopped in this field for a picnic which they called lunch  ,8,8
48954,Dwight, total deaths belongs to gettysburg but when youre talking about dpa thats deaths per acre  ,8,8
48956,Dwight, nothing beats the battle of schrute farms  ,8,8
48958,Dwight, oh it is and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home i mean it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush laughs im telling you theyre heartbreaking too so beautifully written  ,8,8

49011,Pam, um excuse me im gonna go to the bathroom  ,8,8

49029,Andy, hunger hunger for victory hunger for honor hunger for pride  ,8,8
49033,Andy, exactly now do you know the civil war soldiers were hungry for pride now each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives colonel harrison jeffords of the fourth michigan infantry saw his flag being carried away chased it down with nothing but a sword fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died he wasnt about to let them have that flag pride right guys holds up flag i commissioned this flag for dunder mifflin cost me two hundred dollars  ,8,8
49034,Jim, only two hundred dollars  ,8,8
49035,Andy, we are all branches on this tree and from the tree comes paper were all part of a business but business is war whats that i hear uh a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag wha whats going on here weehoo come and get it whos gonna get the flag whos getting it whoa hey ho dont look where i am look where im going juke right juke left  ,8,8

49043,Dwight, andy looks back to find everyone sitting you said you werent going to look back  ,8,8
49049,Dwight, really  ,8,8
49051,Dwight, well  anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms  ,8,8

49058,Dwight, hallowed ground  ,8,8
49062,Dwight, ive seen enough  ,8,8

49077,Andy, you guys came  wheres everyone else  ,8,8
49079,Andy, yeah i asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there  i guess he follows orders  ,8,8
49080,Jim, yeah sorry everyone else didnt come  i think theyre just tired  with holes in their shoes  and they have dysentery    ,8,8
49081,Andy, even without an audience youre still at it  ,8,8
49082,Jim, what are you talking about  ,8,8
49083,Andy, our office has a disease  and it goes by many names  sarcasm  snark  wisecracks  you take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes  thats what you did with this trip  ,8,8
49084,Jim, andy  this whole idea of our situation being just like war  its just not true  we just work at a paper company  and youre our regional manager  and guess what man  you dont have to prove anything  we like you as regional manager  andy if you dont believe me take a look at whats on my head  im wearing a very pink hat  ive been getting weird looks all day because im pretty sure dm does gb means something kinda sexual  but guess whos wearing them  all of us  just for you man  thats huge  ,8,8
49085,Andy, you dont like the hats  ,8,8
49086,Jim, theyre terrible  ,8,8
49088,Andy, they just didnt turn out how i wanted  in my head they were cooler but they do look weird  ,8,8
49089,Andy, voiceover the three walking the world will little note nor long remember the fight jim and i had here at gettysburg and thats good because i was basically wrong  i wanted my team to be like this army and i was their general  but i guess its really more like theyre just people who work in an office and im their manager  yeah thats really probably a better analogy now that i think about it  ,8,8
49098,Andy, charge  ,8,8
49101,Andy, its kind of a haul so we should probably get going and tuna i made a special sandwich for you guess which kind  ,8,8

57532,Dwight, well its a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman   ,9,13
57534,Dwight, all right do you see yourself as more of a team player or a selfstarter  ,9,13
57536,Dwight, there were only two options   ,9,13

57559,Dwight, okay heres one a customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock  you cant rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party   ,9,13

57576,Pam, well of course not but does physical appearance include smell   ,9,13
57581,Dwight, next up my cousin mose mose could make a great paper salesman hes got a natural fear of paper which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible ive got big expectations mosewise   ,9,13
57582,Dwight, what quality would make you a good sales associate  ,9,13
57584,Dwight, it says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for dow chemical   ,9,13
57586,Dwight, you know we live together right   ,9,13
57588,Dwight, and ive never seen you go to work ever   ,9,13

57602,Dwight, when i was young i spent several years at a private school where i was told i would be taught to harness my mutant abilities turned out it was a conman copying charles xaviers school for gifted youngsters from the xmen comic books took me years to figure out that it was a con some people never figured it out   ,9,13

57616,Dwight, david  ,9,13
57618,Dwight, really thats interesting cause i was thinking that since jim is only here part time he might not be as invested in the decisionmaking process as someone like me whos here every day and frankly killing it lately   ,9,13
57619,Jim, i was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk near my wife  ,9,13
57621,Jim, oh um  ,9,13
57623,Jim, okay i cant say that thats not fair   ,9,13
